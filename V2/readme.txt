### Network Sniffer V2
This is the Secound over work of this thing. ive thrown out the listing part of it (for now) and reworked the intire package identifying and how packages are interpreted.
The previous way in wich there was a forloop for identifying if a package was new or known. and then having 2 times almost the same code for either
new macs or known macs was not very elegant.

also with beacons ive run into a kinda dead end for now, so i dicided to go thourgh packages in the order of most commenly seen. <- if that even makes sence.
so request packages got me way more forward although that also kinda shook up my understanding of requests and respones but i want to keep up with all that stuff.
anyway beacons are next anyway ... i find it frustrating how hard it is, to find info on that standart ... im kinda not sure what or who to trust, because sometimes
infos i find conflict.
