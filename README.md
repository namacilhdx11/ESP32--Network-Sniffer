# ESP32--Network-Sniffer

This started as a Schoolprojekt but i found so interesting that i want to continue it a little until it might become a usefull tool.
Right now this thing can read out packages and identify different parts of it i want to make it able to reconstruct devices and Accses points in a Network.
